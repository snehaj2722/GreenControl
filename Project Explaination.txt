PROBLEM: Geo Tracking of Waste and Triggering Alerts and Mapping Areas with High Waste Index.

SOLUTION:

"A young man returns to his home town after 10years, he is astonished to see cleaners taking a photo of the cleaned area. 
He asks his mom what are they doing? His mom states that "This is the improvement which happened in this years to clean the society -iGreen ".
His mind started to think "What is this iGreen?".He started to surf the net and say a video. 
The video's idea to convey was if you find dirt nearby just help us by uploading an image then it's our duty to clean it. 
He started to dig in more to know about the process by visiting the site. He went found some garbage uploaded its photo. 
Then it asked for location co-ordinates for which he gave access. 
After the confirmation that the photo he uploaded consists of garbage then a ticket is created message was shown to him. 
After some time he received a message to confirm whether the area is cleaned completely. 
When he clicked agree there comes a message your ticket is successfully closed and you helped us clean a location. 
Now he understood the process. He also found more in the site like DIY videos, News and Updates, LeaderBoard of their society. 
He wanted to know how it is notified so he digs in more where he realized that when a ticket has created the map of cleaner 
gets pinned and the cleaners go there by following the map upload the cleaned image to complete the process."


A user-friendly software application is built. This application collects images from users then the image passes through the verification process. 
New Ticket is created if it is verified. After waste is cleaned ticket closes.
